Websockets - they are a communications protocol over a single TCP connection that enables interactions between a browser and server. Itâ€™s a real time connection enabling easy transfer of messages from the browser and the server. 

* For serial communcation npm install serialport 

* For the proxy's websocket server - npm install express
Express.js - is a framework for node.js that allows easy creation of a web mobile application and to easily create APIs

* npm install johnny-five

Launch the server with: node proxy.js\

# Explanation of code:

* We have a node server and P5 js sketch 
The P5 js sketch is going to connect to the node server with socket.io

* The js code executes onto the browser but the browser has to get that js code from somewhere

* We want the server to host the html and js files for the sketch itself 
To change the server to be a web server 

* Express web application framework that allows the server to become a web server
